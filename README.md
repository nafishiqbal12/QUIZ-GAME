# Quiz Game in C

## Overview
This project is a simple **Quiz Game** implemented in C. The game presents a set of multiple-choice questions to the player, who must select the correct answer to score points. The questions are chosen randomly to make the game more engaging.

---

## Features
- **Randomized Questions**: Questions are picked randomly from a predefined set.
- **Multiple-Choice Options**: Each question has four options to choose from.
- **Score Tracking**: The playerâ€™s score is calculated based on correct answers.

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
The `Question` structure is used to store the following details for each question:
- `question`: The quiz question as a string.
- `options[4]`: An array containing four possible answers.
- `correct_options`: An integer representing the correct option (1-based index).

### Core Functions
1. **`displayQuestion(Question q)`**
   - Displays a question and its corresponding options.

2. **`checkAnswer(Question q, int user_answer)`**
   - Checks if the user's selected option matches the correct answer.

### Game Flow
1. The program initializes a list of predefined questions.
2. Questions are randomized using `rand()`.
3. For each question:
   - The question and its options are displayed.
   - The user selects an option.
   - The user's answer is validated, and the score is updated.
